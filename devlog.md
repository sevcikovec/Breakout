# DEVLOG

<details>

<summary>Week 1</summary>

    Setup project with cmake

    Added libraries for basic work with openGL: GLFW and GLEW
    
    Added Lodepng library for loading textures
    
    Added 3D Vector and Matrix structs with desired functionality

    Added basic support for loading, compiling and using shaders
</details>

<details>

<summary>Week 2</summary>

    Updated project structure - engine as lib, added separate Game project.

    Added simple renderer - now supporting VBO, IBO and array objects. Also supports custom shader data layout.

    Added entity component system supporting basic components - tranform, name ...

    Added scriptable components - possible to add behaviour to entity as component.
</details>

<summary>Week 3</summary>

    Added rendering system - automatically render all entities with mesh and shader components.

    Added some math classes - quaternion, mat4, vec4.

    Added camera.

    Added uniform buffer support.

    Added keyboard input support.
</details>

<summary>Week 4</summary>

    Added material class - storing shader and uniform variables.

    Added generation of ark and circle mesh with parameters.

    Added behaviour of player arch (moving around the platform)

    Added conversions between cartesian and polar/cylindrical coords.

    Added bounding box component and its visualization (so far only manual setting)

<summary>Week 5</summary>

    Nothing commited - Easter holiday.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Week 6</summary>

    Added generation of sphere mesh.

    Slightly reworked systems and component gathering - now using templated view to iterate over entities with selected components.
    
    Physics WIP 
    - added colliders (sphere, box and arc)
    - naive broad phase checking all entities with collider
    - narrow phase: resolving basic colision between sphere and arc
    - implemented propagating collision information to the entity (possible to react to collision- e.g. bounce, destroying brick etc.)
